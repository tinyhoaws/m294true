Show, Add, Edit, Delete

These tests aim to check all primary functions of the todo list, like adding new todos or editing/deleting existing ones.

Assuming everything works you would open your todolist by clicking on the "Refresh/Show List" Button. You would the then enter the desired text for the 
desired todo into the topmost input field and press the "Add" button, adding a new todo to the end of your list. To delete on you would press on the button
with an "X", this would delete the todo. To edit one you would press the "Edit" button next to a todo, which would reveal an input box and a "Save" button,
clicking the "Edit" button again should hide the input field and "Save" button again. Entering something into the input field and pressing "Save" should alter
the chosen todo. Trying to save or add a blank todo should display and error and not execute the function.


Showing the list of todos

1. Press Refresh/Show list to display your list of todos 
2. Alternatively adding a new todo should also display them, while adding the new one aswell.

Result: Everything works, including the error if you leave the add field empty.


Adding a new todo

1. Enter text into the input field
2. click "Add"
